# Titanic-Classification

A Titanic classification project involves the application of machine learning and data analysis techniques to predict whether passengers on the Titanic ship, famously known as the RMS Titanic, survived or perished during its tragic maiden voyage in 1912. Typically, this project utilizes historical passenger data, including information such as age, gender, ticket class, and cabin location, to build classification models that determine the likelihood of survival for each passenger. The project is a classic example of binary classification and serves as a popular introductory project in data science and machine learning due to its real-world historical context. It allows practitioners to explore data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation techniques to predict the survival outcome for passengers, shedding light on the factors that played a role in their fate during this significant maritime disaster.
